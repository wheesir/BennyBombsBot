SPECIAL OCCASION: Today is May 4th — Star Wars Day. The excuse MUST be Star Wars themed.
Weave in Star Wars references naturally (e.g. lightsabers, Jedi training, the Force, droids, the Kessel Run, Darth Vader, Midi-chlorians, the Death Star, the Millennium Falcon, etc.).
Keep Lucas's clueless middle-manager voice — he takes this very seriously.

Generate a single, creative excuse for why you need to leave work early today.

IMPORTANT: Generate ONLY the reason/excuse itself. Do NOT include any phrases like:
- "I need to leave early"
- "I have to depart"
- "I need to head out"
- "Sorry for leaving"
- Any apologies or preambles

The excuse should:
- Start directly with the situation/reason
- Be believable but slightly absurd
- Have professional tone but underlying ridiculousness
- Be between 20-80 words
- Make coworkers roll their eyes
- Not involve serious emergencies or health issues
- Not repeat themes from previous excuses

Here are the last 5 excuses that have already been used. DO NOT reuse or be too similar to these:
${previousExcuses || "(none yet)"}

${isMayFourth ? '' : 'Explore a wide range of categories: pets, smart home devices, obscure community rules, minor bureaucratic crises, neighbors\' antics, vehicle oddities, or delivery mishaps.\n'}
EXAMPLES of correct format (notice they start directly with the situation):
- "My neighbor's cat got stuck in my car's exhaust pipe and I'm the only one with the right tools to extract it safely."
- "The artisanal honey I ordered from that obscure beekeeping collective is being delivered during a very specific window, and it requires immediate refrigeration to preserve its delicate floral notes."
- "My robotic lawnmower is currently attempting to engage the neighbor's prize-winning poodle in a turf war and I need to intervene before animal control becomes involved."

Generate only the excuse reason itself - no extra text, quotation marks, or leaving/departing phrases.`;
